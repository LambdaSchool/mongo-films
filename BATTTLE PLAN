### Import Sample Data

### Start the API and Implement Requirements
- [X] To start the server, type yarn start or npm start from the root folder (where the package.json file is).
- [X] Take some time to study the code provided.
- [X] Configure relationships on the provided mongoose Schemas.
- [ ] Write endpoints to perform the following queries;
===Film===
- [X] /api/films
- [ ] /api/films?producer=gary+kurtz
- [ ] /api/films?released=2005
===Characters===
- [X] /api/characters/:id
- [ ] /api/characters/:id/vehicles
- [ ] /api/characters?minheight=100
===Planet===
- [X] /api/planet/:id
- [ ] Test the API using Postman as you work through the exercises.

### Stretch Problems
- [ ] Use create-react-app to create an application inside the root folder, name it client.
- [ ] From the React application connect to the /api/films endpoint in the API and show the list of Characters
- [ ] Style the list of characters however you see fit.
- [ ] Add as many CRUD endpoints as you can for the Resources to make it a full API.
